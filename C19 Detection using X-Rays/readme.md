## Aim

- The aim of this project is to create a model that will be able to determine from <code>x-rays</code>, which patiets have been labeled corona positive and which are standard x-rays
- The model will need to find subtle patterns in the images, so we'll need to utilise <code>CNN/code> models & build a <code>binary classifier</code> 
- We will need to find both normal and corona positive x-ray images & utilise the <code>keras</code> deep learning module to classify images 

## Keywords

<code>x-rays images</code> <code>sorted folders</code>

## Dataset
- The dataset being used in this project have been combined from two different sources **[source 1](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset)** **[source 2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)**
- <code>Source 1</code> contains images from x-rays of patients who have been labeled to be corona positive patients
- <code>Source 2</code> contains images from normal x-rays
