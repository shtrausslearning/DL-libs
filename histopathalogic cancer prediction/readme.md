### Project Keywords ðŸ“’

`binary` `classification` `breast` `cancer` `histopathalogic` `analysis` `SLN` `PyTorch`

#### Project Background ðŸ“¥

- Microscopic evaluation of histopathalogic stained tissue & its subsequent digitalisation is now a more feasible due to the advances in slide scanning technology, as well a reduction in digital storage cost in recent years
- There are certain advantages that come with such digitalised pathology; including remote diagnosis, instant archival access & simplified procedure of consultations with expert pathologists
- Digitalised Analysis based on Deep Learning has shown potential benefits as a potential diagnosis tool & strategy
- [Gulshan et al](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2588763) and [Esteva et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28117445/) demonstrated the <b>potential of deep learning for diabetic retinopathy screening</b> and <b>skin lesion classification</b>, respectively
- An essential task performed by pathologist; accurate breast cancer staging 
- Assessment of the extent of **cancer spread by histopathological analysis** of sentinel axillary lymph nodes `SLN` is an **essential part of breast cancer staging process**
- The sensitivity of `SLN` assessment by pathologists, however, is not optimal. A retrospective study showed that **pathology review by experts** changed the nodal status in 24% of patients
- `SLN` assessment is <b>tedious</b> and <b>time-consuming</b>. It has been shown that DL algorithms could identify metastases in `SLN` slides with 100% sensitivity, whereas 40% of the slides without metastases could be identified as such
- This could result in a <b>significant reduction in the workload</b> of pathologists

### Project Aim ðŸŽ¯ 

- The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of using the `PyTorch` DL module for the <b>detection of metastases</b> in `SLN` slides and compare them with the predefined pathologist diagnosis
