### 1 | Hummingbird monitoring

- The purpose of this project is to create an image <code>classifier</code> for hummingbird **species** and **genders** that visit feeders. 
- Such a classifier should be applicable to anywhere that hummingbirds migrate or breed, given additional datasets for those species.
- Hummingbird migration is otherwise reliant on individual bird watchers to see and report their observations. 
- If avid bird lovers setup a similar system, then conservation organizations would have better information on migratory and breeding patterns. 
- This knowledge can be used to determine if specific changes in the environment or ecology has positively or negatively impacted bird life.

### 2 | Reasons for turning to machine learning

- With the increased affordability of visual monitoring equipment, it has become practical for anyone to contribute to such a wonderful cause & help make each sighting more valid. 
- Often, due to <b>limitations of gear</b>, <b>poor photography/videography technique</b>, or **<span style='color:#B6DA32'>simply poor lighting conditions</span>**, it can be difficult for users, <b>let alone experts</b> to distinguish what specific bird was seen at the time of monitoring.
- In this study, we will focus our attention to a bird called the <b>hummingbird</b>. What is useful about this specie is that, despite being quite distinguishible in shape, <b>they have a variery of unique colouring</b>, which means that if images are of poor quality, it may be hard for humans or models to distinguish them.
- In the entire process of <b>expert identification</b> & dealing with various image related inconsistencies outlied previously, manual identification for monitoring can be quite labourous, so an automated system of identification can go a long way.
- In our quest to create an automated approach, we can be left with a collection or under or over exposed images that will create difficulties for the model to distinguish between different classes correctly. 

### 3 | Project goal 

- The ultimate goal is to have a classification system that can address such the above stated varieties in an image & correctly distinguish very similar bird species, it should be deployable at any feeder, which is important to the continued monitoring of hummingbird species and bird  migration patterns. 

### 4 | The dataset

- The dataset contains a main folder; <code>hummingbirds</code>, which contains image data split into <code>training</code>, <code>validation</code> & <code>test</code> sets, so the <code>train/test</code> split has already been done for us

```python
''' Folder Pathways'''
main_folder = '/kaggle/input/hummingbirds-at-my-feeders/'
train_folder = '/kaggle/input/hummingbirds-at-my-feeders/hummingbirds/train/'
val_folder = '/kaggle/input/hummingbirds-at-my-feeders/hummingbirds/valid/'
test_folder = '/kaggle/input/hummingbirds-at-my-feeders/hummingbirds/test/'
video_folder = '/kaggle/input/hummingbirds-at-my-feeders/video_test/'
```

```python

os.listdir(main_folder)

```

> ['video_test', 'All_images', 'hummingbirds']

```python
os.listdir(train_folder)
```

> ['Rufous_female', 'No_bird', 'Broadtailed_female', 'Broadtailed_male']

- Let's check how many images there are in each folder <code>Rufous female</code>, <code>No bird</code>, <code>Broadtailed female</code> & <code>Broadtailed male</code>
- We have a total of **4 classes**, so we'll be treating the problem as as <code>multiclass</code> classification problem

```python

class_types = len(os.listdir(train_folder))
print('Number of classes for Classification: ',class_types)
class_names = os.listdir(train_folder)
print(f'The class names are {class_names}\n')

print('Training dataset:')
for i in class_names:
    print(i + ':' + str(len(os.listdir(train_folder+i))))

print('\nValidation dataset:')
for i in class_names:
    print(i + ':' + str(len(os.listdir(val_folder+i))))
    
print('\nTest dataset:')
for i in class_names:
    print(i + ':' + str(len(os.listdir(test_folder+i))))
    
```

- The class distribution is even, the <code>training</code> data containing **100 samples** per class & both <code>validation</code> and <code>test</code> data containing **20 samples** per class

```
Number of classes for Classification:  4
The class names are ['Rufous_female', 'No_bird', 'Broadtailed_female', 'Broadtailed_male']

Training dataset:
Rufous_female:100
No_bird:100
Broadtailed_female:100
Broadtailed_male:100

Validation dataset:
Rufous_female:20
No_bird:20
Broadtailed_female:20
Broadtailed_male:20

Test dataset:
Rufous_female:20
No_bird:20
Broadtailed_female:20
Broadtailed_male:20
```

### 5 | Image Exploration

#### **RUFOUS FEMALE**
- The addition of the <b>female as opposed to the male</b> is an interesting choice for the dataset, making it indeed very challenging for the model, due to the high similarity of different species' image values. The female, unlike the male is very similar to the <b>broadtail female</b>, <b>especially when in the shade</b>, we actually have quite a few such cases, as seen in the images below.
- However we can notice that in all images, colours of the back/rump are <b>quite dull, more saturated, but with hints of green</b>, just enough to be able to make out the green colour.
- We can also note that the images have quite a <b>bit of "noise"</b>, that could potentally affect the accuracy of the model; <b>the feeder & the flag introduce red values into the images</b>, which can affect the model accuracy.

#### **BROADTAIL FEMALE**
- To the naked eye, there is <b>a lot of similarities</b> between the <b>Rufous</b> & <b>Broadtail Females</b>.
- Without adequate lighting and refence to multiple frames (such as from a video), one could easily mislabel the species.
- The boadtail female colour definitely stand out more, the two species so far have very similar bagrounds & the ocassional feeder.

#### **BROADTAIL MALE**
- Like the adult female, the males also have green and buffy flanks.
- What separates the male broadtail from the female and even from the Rufous female is the **distinctive rose/magenta throats**.
- It's quite likely the model would be easily able to classify any image containing the male from the rest, if the feeder or flag wasn't of similar color.
- We can clearly observe that the feeder, has both darker spots and lighter spots, lighter spots have values very similar values to the throat.
- We can also note some images don't visibly have this distinctive red colour throat (at least to the naked eye), one possible reason being that the bird is <b>in the shade at the time of capture</b>. It's also possible that the images are not correctly labeled, which cannot also be ruled out. However we can clearly note that the model will need to adapt to images <b>taken under direct sunlight</b> and <b>different shade variations</b>, which create some problematic scenarios.
- And <b>last but not least</b>, we can't rule out <b>immature males</b> from the pack as well. They are extremly similar to female as well.

#### **NO BIRD**
- Given the amount of background noise/clutter (non bird pixels) we have in our images, <b>no_bird images seem like significant additions</b>.
- Especially important are the <b>flag</b> & <b>feeder</b> images which we saw in the background of some of the hummingbird images.
- The subset is quite self explanatory, no birds are present in any of the images, showing the environment around the feeder.
