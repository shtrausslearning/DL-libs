### 1 | Hummingbird monitoring

- The purpose of this project is to create an image <code>classifier</code> for hummingbird **species** and **genders** that visit feeders. 
- The ultimate goal is to have a classification system that can be deployed at any feeder, which is important to the continued monitoring of hummingbird species and bird  migration patterns. 
- Such a system is applicable to anywhere that hummingbirds migrate or breed, given additional datasets for those species.
- Hummingbird migration is otherwise reliant on individual bird watchers to see and report their observations. 
- If avid bird lovers setup a similar system, then conservation organizations would have better information on migratory and breeding patterns. 
- This knowledge can be used to determine if specific changes in the environment or ecology has positively or negatively impacted bird life.
